# MATERIALS AND METHODS
## A. Experimental setup
The dataset used in the project was obtained using a
setup containing a Raspberry Pi 3 single board computer. A
50W/12V solar panel was installed to obtain the PV power
generation data. To obtain the sky images, a raspberry pi
camera v2 was used together with a 160-degree fish eye lens to
achieve a greater field of view. Image settings were configured
as, Resolution – 3280x2464, ISO - 250, Exposure time –
0.4ms, auto white balance set to ‘off’ and reasonable values
are set for white balance gains, in order to get consistent
images. To acquire the PV generation data, An INA219 power
monitor was used in the system. The hardware diagram of the
experimental setup is displayed in the Fig 1.
The solar panel and the Rasbery Pi camera were mounted
on the rooftop of a house in Gampaha, Sri Lanka.

## B. Data collection
The images captured by the pi camera were stored in the
computer in JPEG format and PV generation data was stored
in CSV file format. An example image from the dataset is
illustrated in Fig. 2. The dataset for the project were obtained
from the data collection system installed at a residential
building in Gampaha, Sri Lanka. The system was designed
to capture sky images and record PV generation data at
predefined intervals of 30 seconds during 05:00h to 20:00h.
Data captured from 27th March 2022 to 25th April 2022 were
used to forecasting model.
